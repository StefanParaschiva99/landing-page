## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## 📚 What I learned

## Motivation
I created this project for "The Odin Project" course. The motivation was to put into practice what I have studied and verify my skills. As it was my very first project I learned a lot, such as how to deal with some small problems that may also arise in a real project, plus I was very happy that I created something functional from scratch.
